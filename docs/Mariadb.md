MariaDB Service Documentation
## Dockerfile: db.Dockerfile

### Purpose
MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a fork of MySQL. It is designed to be highly compatible with MySQL while offering additional features, performance improvements, and enhanced security. In this project, MariaDB is used as the primary database server to store and manage application data.

The primary purposes of using MariaDB in this project are:

- Data Storage: Store structured data for the application, including user information, content, and configuration settings.
- Data Management: Provide robust data management capabilities, including transactions, indexing, and querying.
- Scalability: Support horizontal and vertical scaling to handle increasing amounts of data and traffic.
- Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with MySQL-based applications and tools.

### Configuration in This Project
The MariaDB configuration in this project is defined in the `db.Dockerfile` and includes custom configuration files and initialization scripts.

#### Base Image:
The Dockerfile uses the `debian:bookworm-slim` base image to ensure a minimal and secure environment.

#### Installation:
MariaDB server and tini are installed using `apt-get`.
tini is a minimal init system used to handle reaping zombie processes and signal forwarding.

#### Custom Configuration:
The custom MariaDB configuration file `50-server.cnf` is copied to `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/`.
This configuration file can include custom settings for MariaDB, such as buffer sizes, cache settings, and performance tuning parameters.

#### Initialization Scripts:
The SQL initialization script `init.sql` is copied to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`.
The shell script `init.sh` is copied to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sh` and made executable.
These scripts are used to initialize the database with necessary schemas, tables, and initial data.

#### Directory Setup:
The directory `/run/mysqld` is created to ensure that the MariaDB server has the necessary runtime directories.

#### Entrypoint and Command:
The entrypoint is set to `tini` to ensure proper process management.
The command runs the initialization script and then starts the MariaDB server.

### Alternatives to MariaDB
#### MySQL:
- Description: The original open-source relational database management system that MariaDB is forked from.
- Pros: Widely used, extensive documentation, large community support.
- Cons: Some features are now exclusive to Oracle's commercial versions.

#### PostgreSQL:
- Description: An advanced open-source relational database known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance.
- Pros: Advanced features (e.g., JSONB, full-text search), strong ACID compliance, active development.
- Cons: Slightly steeper learning curve, different SQL dialect compared to MySQL/MariaDB.

#### SQLite:
- Description: A lightweight, file-based relational database management system.
- Pros: Simple setup, minimal configuration, suitable for small to medium-sized applications.
- Cons: Not suitable for high-concurrency or large-scale applications.

#### Microsoft SQL Server:
- Description: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft.
- Pros: Strong integration with Microsoft products, robust features, high performance.
- Cons: Commercial licensing, higher resource requirements.

#### Oracle Database:
- Description: A multi-model database management system developed by Oracle Corporation.
- Pros: Comprehensive feature set, high performance, strong support for enterprise applications.
- Cons: Expensive licensing, complex setup and management.

### Summary
MariaDB is chosen for this project due to its compatibility with MySQL, enhanced features, and open-source nature. It is configured using a custom Dockerfile that installs MariaDB, sets up custom configuration files, and initializes the database with necessary schemas and data. While there are several alternatives available, MariaDB stands out for its balance of performance, features, and ease of use, making it a suitable choice for this project's database needs.
