## Prometheus Documentation

### Overview: What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It is designed for reliability, scalability, and extensibility in dynamic environments, such as microservices architectures. Prometheus collects and stores time-series data, making it ideal for monitoring applications, services, and infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-dimensional data model:** Prometheus stores data as time-series, identified by metric names and key-value pairs (labels).
- **Powerful query language (PromQL):** Used to select and aggregate data.
- **No reliance on distributed storage:** Prometheus runs as a single node that handles both collection and storage.
- **Push and pull model:** Metrics can be either pulled from services or pushed using Prometheus' Pushgateway.
- **Alerting:** Prometheus integrates with Alertmanager for alerting based on defined rules.

### Why Do We Need Prometheus?

Modern infrastructure often consists of many components (servers, databases, load balancers, etc.), each generating performance data and logs. Without a dedicated monitoring system, identifying performance bottlenecks, failures, or trends becomes difficult.

Prometheus provides real-time insights into the system by:
- **Monitoring system health:** It ensures that systems are running as expected by collecting metrics and analyzing them over time.
- **Alerting on issues:** Prometheus generates alerts when pre-defined thresholds are crossed (e.g., high CPU usage, service downtime).
- **Visualizing performance trends:** With tools like Grafana, Prometheus data can be used to build dashboards that visualize system behavior and performance.

### Common Services Used with Prometheus

While Prometheus operates independently, it is often paired with several other tools and services for a complete observability stack:
- **Alertmanager:** Handles alerts generated by Prometheus and routes them based on user-defined rules (e.g., email, Slack).
- **Grafana:** A visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus for building dynamic dashboards based on collected metrics.
- **Exporters:** Tools that expose application metrics in a Prometheus-friendly format. Each exporter collects and exposes metrics from a specific service or system.
  - Common exporters include Node Exporter (for system metrics), NGINX Exporter, and MySQL Exporter.
  
Other integrations might include Kubernetes (for monitoring containers) or service meshes like Istio.

### Project Use Case: Monitoring NGINX Performance

In this project, Prometheus will be used to monitor the performance of NGINX, a popular web server and reverse proxy. To do this, we will leverage the **NGINX Exporter**.

#### How It Works:
1. **NGINX Exporter Container:**
   The NGINX Exporter container acts as an intermediary between Prometheus and NGINX. It collects key performance metrics from the NGINX status module (like requests per second, active connections, etc.) and translates them into a format that Prometheus can understand.

2. **Metrics Collection:**
   Prometheus pulls the metrics from the NGINX Exporter at regular intervals. These metrics are stored as time-series data in Prometheus.

3. **Metrics Monitoring:**
   Using PromQL, you can query these metrics to observe NGINX performance trends, such as:
   - Number of active connections
   - Request rates (successful or failed requests)
   - Response times

4. **Alerting:**
   Based on thresholds you define (e.g., high error rates, excessive response time), Prometheus can trigger alerts via the Alertmanager, notifying you of potential issues in real-time.

### Why Use Prometheus for NGINX Monitoring?

- **Scalability:** Prometheus is highly scalable, making it suitable for both small and large NGINX setups.
- **Real-time monitoring:** Get real-time performance data of NGINX servers and react to issues immediately.
- **Customization:** Prometheus allows you to define custom metrics, which you can visualize and alert on, giving fine-grained control over what you monitor.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Prometheus to monitor and improve system reliability, starting with NGINX performance monitoring through the NGINX Exporter.
