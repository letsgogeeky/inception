## NGINX Service Documentation

### Overview

NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server used to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It is known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. In this project, NGINX is configured to serve as the primary web server, handling both HTTP and HTTPS requests, and providing SSL termination.

### Purpose

* The primary purpose of NGINX in this project is to:
  * Serve static content: Efficiently serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
  * Reverse proxy: Forward client requests to backend services, such as a WordPress application or other microservices.
  * SSL termination: Handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, providing secure HTTPS connections to clients.
  * Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

### Configuration in This Project

The NGINX configuration in this project is defined in the `nginx.Dockerfile` and the custom configuration file `nginx.conf`. Below are the key steps and configurations:


### Alternatives to NGINX

* **Apache HTTP Server:**
  * **Pros:** Highly configurable, extensive documentation, large community support.
  * **Cons:** Higher resource consumption compared to NGINX, potentially more complex configuration.
* **HAProxy:**
  * **Pros:** Excellent load balancing capabilities, high performance, and reliability.
  * **Cons:** Primarily focused on load balancing, less feature-rich as a web server compared to NGINX.
* **Caddy:**
  * **Pros:** Simple configuration, automatic HTTPS, built-in support for HTTP/2.
  * **Cons:** Smaller community, fewer features compared to NGINX and Apache.
* **Traefik:**
  * **Pros:** Dynamic configuration, integrates well with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
  * **Cons:** Can be complex to set up for simple use cases, less mature than NGINX.

### Summary

NGINX is chosen for this project due to its high performance, low resource consumption, and versatility in handling various web server and reverse proxy tasks. It is configured to serve static content, act as a reverse proxy, and handle SSL termination using a self-signed certificate. While there are several alternatives available, NGINX stands out for its balance of performance, features, and ease of configuration.
